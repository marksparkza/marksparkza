Greetings, Earthlings!

I’m Mark, and I am an Earthling. I’m also, incidentally, a South African Jew, and I support freedom for all the peoples of Palestine. :dove:

By day, I'm Systems Development Lead at the South African Environmental Observation Network.

I have a deep interest in the Python programming language, in the idea of consciousness as a dimension of reality, and in working for the betterment of all life on our planet.
